You must have the Python package SDV installed to run the Data Synthesis
run the command:
pip install sdv

Diary for personal notes on what I have been working on.
--------------------------------------------------------

16/01/2023
----------
Making sure all documentation is in text cells as opposed to code cells.

14/01/2023
----------
I noticed one of the cells was not dislaying in github. Updated code to fix this. I had to use a workaround and put in a blank print statement to stop an unnecessary printuot.

13/01/2023
----------
Making changes based on feedback from project 1. Making sure all figures are present and have titles. Also making changes to the section headings to make the distinction between them clearer.


10/01/2023
----------
Worked on Data Synthesis, classifying the synthesised data and conclusion.


09/01/2023
----------
Started on the Data Synthesis literature review and writing code in my notebook.


08/01/2023
----------
Investigating Random Forest Classification in the literature and wrote code to classify the data in my notebook.
Also created functions to eliminate duplicate code (DRY programming principle).
General tidy up of notebook.


06/01/2023
----------
Investigating Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes Classification and Logistic Regression Classification in the literature and wrote code to classify the data in my notebook.

When back over Support Vector Classification, Logistic Regression Classification and K-nearest neighbour classification and put in code to do the classification using all columns. Before now I was only using the mean columns but it is more accurate using all the columns.


05/01/2023
----------
Investigating Support Vector Classification and Logistic Regression Classification in the literature and wrote code to classify the data in my notebook.


04/01/2023
----------
Investigating K-nearest neighbour classification in the literature and wrote code to for same to classify the datain in my notebook.


03/01/2023
----------
Working on K Nearest Neighbour training for the dataset.


01/01/2023
----------
Continued with the literature review.
Created code to compare the mean characteristics of the cell nuclei for the two diagnosis, benign and malignant.


30/12/2022
----------
Further work on Literature review.
Working with correlation of cell nuclei characteristics to diagnosis and other cell nuclei characteristics.


29/12/2022
----------
Did a check for zeros in the dataset and got metadata about it.
Also generated 3 individual dataframes, one for columns based on mean, another one for columns based on standard errors and the final one for columns based on the worst values.
Some other tweaks to the notebook.
Started on Literature review


28/12/2022
----------
Further research for introduction to data.
Tidy up of notebook and Table of contents started.


27/12/2022
----------
Doing research for literature review. Added some information from same.


23/12/2022
----------
Import the dataset from both UCI and Kaggle websites and compare. 
The kaggle dataset has the column names included so i have decided to use this for that reason.
Did some initial enalysis on the dataset.


16/12/2022
----------
Started research for the project
Created git hub repository and started the jupyter notebook.
