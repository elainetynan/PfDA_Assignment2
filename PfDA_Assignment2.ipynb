    "\n",
    "It contains 32 columns, including an ID and a classification of the tumor as either Benign (B) or Malignant (M). The remaining 30 columns contain information about the cell nuclei. These columns characterise each biopsie with the measurements: mean, standard error and worst of the following 10 characteristics of the cell nuclei:\n",

    "There are 569 rows of data, each one correlating to an individual sample. [See Data](#importdata).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no missing data and 13 samples have a 0 value for all columns related to Concavity (Concavity & Concave Points). See [Missing Values](#checkmissing) and [Zero Values](#checkzeros).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset there are 357 benign samples and 212 malignant samples. [See Classification](#classification).\n",
